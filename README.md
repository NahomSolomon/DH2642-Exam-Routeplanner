# DH2642-Exam-Routeplanner

A "todo/task" app where you can plan out your day. SL Api will be used so you can search for journeys you need to make, For instance if you need to get to school etc. As well as an weather api so you can be prepaired for the weather.

Atm only then /home page is created. Where tasks can be made. But nothing else have been built yet.

    We will create a page for editing your notes, as well as searching for the route you need to make via SL. The login page will be done via firebase.

    We're using MVP, which clearly can be seen via the view and presenter folder.
